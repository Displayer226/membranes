# Social Preview Image Concept

**Dimensions:** 1280 × 640px (GitHub recommended)

## Layout

### Background
Dark gradient — deep navy (#0d1117) to dark teal (#0a2540). Subtle hexagonal grid pattern faintly visible (security/network motif).

### Left Side (40%)
Large shield icon (🛡️) rendered in glowing cyan/electric blue (#58a6ff), semi-translucent. The shield has a subtle membrane texture — like a cell membrane or soap bubble, iridescent with faint rainbow edges.

### Right Side (60%)

**Top:**
`membranes` in a bold, clean monospace font (e.g., JetBrains Mono or IBM Plex Mono), white, large (~72px equivalent). A faint glow/bloom around the text.

**Middle:**
"The VirusTotal for prompt injection" — in a lighter weight, slightly smaller, muted cyan (#8b949e → #58a6ff gradient).

**Bottom:**
Three small pill badges in a row:
- `⚡ Sub-5ms` (green pill)
- `🔒 Zero Dependencies` (blue pill)  
- `🌐 Crowdsourced Intel` (purple pill)

### Accent Details
- Thin horizontal line separating title from tagline
- Small code snippet floating faintly in the background: `scanner.scan(content)` in syntax-highlighted monospace, very low opacity
- Subtle particle/data flow lines going from left → through the shield → to the right (representing content being filtered)

## Mood
Clean, technical, trustworthy. Feels like a security product, not an AI hype tool. Think GitHub's own dark mode aesthetic meets a cybersecurity dashboard.

## Text Only Fallback
If generating with AI image tools is difficult, a clean text-based version works great:
- Dark background
- `🛡️ membranes` large and centered
- Tagline below
- Three feature pills at the bottom
